The examples that we have shown are in 2D, but the conclusions are equally valid in the 3D setting; however solving the problem in 3D is not feasible at the moment for high frequencies using the direct factorization method of the Helmholtz equation that we are using. The parameter $\epsilon$, which controls the regularization strength, requires some tuning. We also know based on comprehensive numerical testing that the regularization scheme works well when the illumination holes are not very large; beyond which one begins to see artificial structures in the migrated image.
