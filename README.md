# Godzilla
A Project started at Stanford to build and test Helmholtz equation solvers in 1D, 2D and 3D. The library uses "fftw" and "SuiteSparse" libraries extensively for fourier transforms and sparse factorization of matrices appearing in the Helmholtz equation solution process.

# Includes the Following
- C++11 source codes
- Python source codes
- MATLAB source codes
